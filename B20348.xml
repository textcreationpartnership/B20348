            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p n="1">1st. The General Assembly considering the Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Grouth of Prophanity, Ignorance and Irreligion, that is too manifest in this Land, and the woful Decay of the Life and Power of Godliness, with the small Success of the Gospel, that's to be observed every where, at this time, the General Assembly, in a deep sense of these things, And for the Remeeding of them, do in the First place, In the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:108667:7"/>aw, and dread of GOD, Beseech, Exhort and Require, all Ministers, by the Coming of our LORD <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and our gathering together unto him, That they take heed to themselves, and to their Doctrine, and endeavour to be Ensamples to the People, in all Piety, Purity, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in all manner of Conversation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That they be Frequent and Fervent in Secret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for themselves, and the People committed to them, Joining sometime Fasting with prayer. And the General Assembly Recommends to Ministers, and Elders in their several Parishes, and Ministers in their several Presbytries, to meet sometimes together in their Parishes, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Respective, for private Fasting and Prayer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference anent the state of the Church, and that part of it, in which they have special interest; with Respect to the Grouth or Decay of Godliness, and Success of the Gospel therein.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Presbytries, be more Accurate in managing their privy Censures, and that a day be set apart to that purpose only, and spent in Fasting and Prayer together.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That Presbytries be very Cautious, in admitting Intrants to the Ministry, and be Accurate and Exact in the Tryal, not only of their Literature, but of their Piety, Prudence, and former Godly Conversation and Walk.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That Ministers be painful in Catechising, frequent in Visiting of Families, and in privat Personal Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with these of their Charge, about the State of their Souls, and that Ministers be more frequent in administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lords Supper, and alwise Edifying in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and Discourse, and that they deal with Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to engage them to Piety, and a care to Reform their Families, and to set up, and to keep up the Worship of GOD therein; And in particular, that Ministers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by all Prudent and gaining Gospel methods, to engage Persons of Honour and Power to fall in love with Holiness, and reckon it, as in deed it is, their greatest Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; And that in dealing with such of them, as are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, an Humble and yet Holy Boldness and Zeal, be us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in admonishing them, in order to their Recovery: And that herein Presbytries appoint some others of their number, to Concur with the Minister of the place as may be most for Edification.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The General Assembly Recommends, to the Kirk Sessions and Presbytries, the Vigorous, Impartial, and yet Prudent Exercise of Church-Discipline against all Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, Especially Drunkeness, and Filthyness, Cursing and Swearing, and Prophaning the Lords day, which too much abound: And that they apply to the Magistrat, for the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:108667:7"/>Execution of the Good Lawes, made against Immorality and Prophanness,</p>
               <p n="7">7. That seing it is observed, that in Burghs, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally these of greatest Resort, as <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> many sit too late in Taverns especially on the Saturdays night, and Men of Business, pretend they do it for Relaxation of their Mindes; through which some neglect the Publick Worship on the LORDS-Day in the Forenoon; and others attend the Worship drousily: Therefore the General Assembly Recommends to all Ministers, where such sinful customs are, to represent to the People both publickly and privatly the sin and evil thereof, and to call them to Redeem that time, which they have free from Business; And to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it for Converse with GOD about their Souls state, and in preparation for the Sabbath, which will yeeld more delight, than all sensual pleasures can do.</p>
               <p>And the General Assembly Beseecheth, and Exhorteth all Magistrates of Burghs, to be assistant to Ministers, in Enquiring into, and Reforming such abuses.</p>
               <p>And siclike the General Assembly, Revives the Act of the General Assembly, dated the 11th, <hi>January</hi> 1697. <hi>Sess.</hi> 8. Entituled Act against Prophanness, and approves of the Overture therein contained anent Censuring such Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Members of Sessions, as are negligent in pursuing Scandals.</p>
               <p>And the General Assembly Recommends and Enacts, the punctual observation of the saids Acts and Overtures, and obedience thereto by all Presbytries, Ministers, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Sessions, as they are concerned, in their several stations, as they will be Answerable.</p>
